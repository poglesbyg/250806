# Data-Flow

## Input Processing
- Raw image input is processed through initial convolutional layer and batch normalization
- First stage establishes base feature representation for subsequent processing

## Feature Map Generation (`models/cnn.py`)
1. Layer 1 Processing:
   - First residual block processes normalized input
   - Generates initial feature maps for basic pattern detection
   - Skip connections preserve gradient information flow

2. Layer 2 Processing:
   - Second residual block increases channel dimensions
   - Produces intermediate-level feature representations
   - Maintains spatial information with batch normalization

3. Layer 3 Processing:
   - Final residual block further expands channel dimensions
   - Creates high-level abstract feature maps
   - Enables extraction via `get_feature_maps` method for visualization

## Feature Aggregation
- Global average pooling reduces spatial dimensions
- Consolidates feature maps into compact representation
- Dropout layer applies regularization to prevent overfitting

## Output Generation
- Final fully connected layer transforms pooled features
- Produces classification logits for 10 CIFAR-10 classes
- Output represents class probability distribution

Importance Score: 85 (Key integration point for model's data transformation pipeline)

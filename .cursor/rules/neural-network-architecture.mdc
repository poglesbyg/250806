### Core Architecture Components
**Importance Score: 95**

`pytorch_showcase/models/cnn.py`:

1. Residual Block Structure:
- Two convolutional layers with batch normalization
- Skip connection pathway for gradient flow
- ReLU activation between layers
- Identity mapping for dimension matching

2. Main Network Topology:
- Initial convolutional layer (input processing)
- Three residual blocks with increasing channels
- Global average pooling layer
- Classification head (fully connected layer)

### Feature Extraction Architecture
**Importance Score: 85**

Layer hierarchy for feature map extraction:
- layer1: Initial feature processing
- layer2: Intermediate representations
- layer3: High-level feature abstraction

### Weight Initialization Strategy
**Importance Score: 75**

Custom initialization scheme:
- He initialization for convolutional layers
- Normal distribution for fully connected layers
- Batch normalization parameter initialization
